## Telemetry Sensors

Starting with version 2.1.0, the MeshCore integration automatically discovers and creates sensors for telemetry data transmitted over the mesh network. These sensors support environmental and IoT data using the Cayenne LPP (Low Power Payload) format.

### Supported Telemetry Types

The integration automatically creates sensors for the following telemetry data types:

**Environmental Sensors:**
- **Temperature** - Temperature readings in °C
- **Humidity** - Relative humidity as a percentage
- **Illuminance** - Light levels in lux
- **Pressure** - Atmospheric pressure sensors
- **Presence** - Motion/presence detection

**Electrical Sensors:**
- **Voltage** - Voltage measurements in volts
- **Current** - Current measurements in amperes
- **Analog Input/Output** - Generic analog sensor readings

**Position & Motion:**
- **GPS** - Automatically creates separate sensors for latitude, longitude, and altitude
- **Accelerometer** - Creates separate X, Y, Z axis sensors

**Other Sensors:**
- **Digital Input/Output** - Binary state sensors
- **Color** - RGB color sensors (creates separate R, G, B sensors)
- **Generic Sensors** - Fallback for custom or unknown sensor types

### Automatic Discovery

Telemetry sensors are automatically discovered when:
1. A mesh node transmits telemetry data using Cayenne LPP format
2. The data is received by your connected MeshCore device
3. The integration processes the telemetry and creates appropriate Home Assistant sensors

### Sensor Naming

Telemetry sensors are automatically named based on:
- **Channel number** - Each telemetry channel gets its own sensor
- **Node name** - Uses the known name of the transmitting node
- **Sensor type** - Temperature, GPS, etc.

Example sensor names:
- `sensor.meshcore_ch1_temperature` (root node temperature on channel 1)
- `sensor.weather_station_ch2_humidity` (humidity from "Weather Station" node)
- `sensor.tracker_ch0_gps_latitude` (GPS latitude from "Tracker" node)

### Battery Monitoring

For battery-powered nodes, the integration provides enhanced battery monitoring:
- **Voltage sensors** show the raw battery voltage
- **Battery percentage sensors** automatically convert voltage to percentage using battery discharge curves
- Both sensors are created when voltage telemetry is received from client devices

### Configuration

Telemetry sensors are automatically enabled and require no manual configuration. The integration:
- Listens for `TELEMETRY_RESPONSE` events from the mesh network
- Dynamically creates sensors as new telemetry sources are discovered
- Updates sensor values in real-time as telemetry data is received
- Marks sensors as unavailable if no data is received for over an hour

### Example Usage

Telemetry sensors can be used in automations like any other Home Assistant sensor:

```yaml
# Temperature alert automation
alias: High Temperature Alert
trigger:
  - platform: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.weather_station_ch1_temperature
    above: 30
action:
  - service: notify.notify
    data:
      message: "Weather station temperature is {{ states('sensor.weather_station_ch1_temperature') }}°C"
```

```yaml
# Battery monitoring automation
alias: Low Battery Alert
trigger:
  - platform: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.remote_sensor_ch1_battery
    below: 20
action:
  - service: notify.notify
    data:
      message: "Remote sensor battery is low: {{ states('sensor.remote_sensor_ch1_battery') }}%"
```

> For more detailed service definitions, see the [services.yaml](custom_components/meshcore/services.yaml) file.

## Event System

The MeshCore integration now uses an event-driven architecture, exposing all events from the meshcore-py library to Home Assistant. This allows for more flexible automations and integrations.

### Raw Events

All events from the MeshCore device are forwarded to the Home Assistant event bus as `meshcore_raw_event`. This allows you to listen for specific events and create automations based on them.

The event data contains:
- `event_type`: The type of event as a string, e.g., "EventType.BATTERY"
- `payload`: The payload of the event (contains the specific data for that event type)
- `timestamp`: When the event was received

Example of listening to raw events in an automation:

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: meshcore_raw_event
    event_data:
      event_type: "EventType.BATTERY"
condition: []
action:
  - service: notify.notify
    data:
      title: "Battery Update"
      message: "Battery status updated: {{ trigger.event.data.payload.voltage }}V ({{ trigger.event.data.payload.percent }}%)"
```

Common event types include:
- `EventType.BATTERY` - Battery status updates
- `EventType.DEVICE_INFO` - Device information updates
- `EventType.CONTACTS` - Contact list updates 
- `EventType.CONTACT_MSG_RECV` - Direct message received
- `EventType.CHANNEL_MSG_RECV` - Channel message received
- `EventType.STATUS_RESPONSE` - Repeater status updates
- `EventType.MSG_SENT` - Message sent confirmation

### Specific Message Events

In addition to raw events, the integration fires specific events for common operations:

- `meshcore_message`: Fired when a message is received (either channel or direct)
- `meshcore_message_sent`: Fired when a message is sent through the integration services

## Automation Examples

Below are examples of automations that utilize the MeshCore services.

> 💡 **Advanced Example**: For a comprehensive example of managing MeshCore contacts through Home Assistant automations, see [Meshcore Contact Management in Home Assistant](https://github.com/WJ4IoT/Meshcore-Contact-Management-in-Home-Assistant).

### Forward New Messages to Push Notifications
```yaml
alias: Meshcore Forward to Push
description: "Forwards all MeshCore messages to a push notification"
triggers:
  - trigger: event
    event_type: meshcore_message
actions:
  - action: notify.notify
    data:
      message: >-
        {% if trigger.event.data.channel is defined %}
          Channel {{ trigger.event.data.channel }}: {{ trigger.event.data.sender_name }}: {{ trigger.event.data.message }}
        {% else %}
          {{ trigger.event.data.sender_name }}: {{ trigger.event.data.message }}
        {% endif %}
mode: single
```

### Scheduled Advertisement Broadcasting

This automation sends an advertisement broadcast every 15 minutes to help maintain network connectivity and make your node more discoverable to other nodes in the mesh network.

```yaml
alias: MeshCore Scheduled Advertisement
description: "Sends a MeshCore advertisement broadcast every 15 minutes"
trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "/15"  # Every 15 minutes
action:
  - service: meshcore.execute_command
    data:
      command: "send_advert"
mode: single
```

## Room Servers

Room Servers are a special type of node in the MeshCore network that provide group chat functionality. Unlike regular nodes, Room Servers:

- Appear as normal contacts in your chat interface
- Allow multiple users to join and communicate in a shared chat room
- Require login before you can engage with them

### Connecting to a Room Server

To use a Room Server, you need to:

1. Add it as a repeater in the MeshCore configuration (even though it's not technically a repeater)
2. This login step is required before you can engage with the Room Server
3. Once added, the Room Server will appear as a normal contact in your mesh network
4. You can then send direct messages to the Room Server, which will be broadcast to all users in the room

When configured properly, Room Server nodes will be displayed with a distinct icon in the UI to help identify them.

## UI Components

The integration provides helper UI components that can be used to create messaging dashboards in Home Assistant.

### Messaging System Card

This card allows sending messages to either channels or specific contacts:

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: entities
    title: MeshCore Messaging
    entities:
      - entity: select.meshcore_recipient_type
        name: Send To
  - type: conditional
    conditions:
      - entity: select.meshcore_recipient_type
        state: Channel
    card:
      type: entities
      entities:
        - entity: select.meshcore_channel
          name: Channel
  - type: conditional
    conditions:
      - entity: select.meshcore_recipient_type
        state: Contact
    card:
      type: entities
      entities:
        - entity: select.meshcore_contact
          name: Contact
  - type: entities
    entities:
      - entity: text.meshcore_message
        name: Message
  - show_name: true
    show_icon: true
    type: button
    name: Send Message
    icon: mdi:send
    tap_action:
      action: call-service
      service: meshcore.send_ui_message
    icon_height: 24px
```

### Command Card

This card provides a simple interface for executing MeshCore commands:

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: entities
    entities:
      - entity: text.meshcore_command
        name: MeshCore Command
  - show_name: true
    show_icon: true
    type: button
    tap_action:
      action: call-service
      service: meshcore.execute_command_ui
    name: Execute Command
    icon: mdi:console
    icon_height: 24px
```

### MeshCore Network Map

This card displays all MeshCore contacts on a map using their location data. It requires the [auto-entities](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities) custom card:

```yaml
type: custom:auto-entities
filter:
  include:
    - integration: meshcore
      entity_id: binary_sensor.meshcore_*_contact
      options:
        label_mod: icon
card:
  type: map
  default_zoom: 15
  label_mode: icon
```

This map will automatically display any MeshCore contacts that have location data (latitude/longitude) available. Contacts will be displayed using their appropriate icons (client, repeater, or room server), making it easy to visualize your mesh network's geographic distribution.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- **USB Connection**: Make sure the device is properly connected and the correct port is selected. Try a different baud rate if the default doesn't work.
- **BLE Connection**: Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your Home Assistant host. Try moving closer to the device if signal strength is low. **Note: BLE pairing over Home Assistant Bluetooth proxy is not currently working until MeshCore supports disabling the PIN requirement.**
- **TCP Connection**: Verify the hostname/IP and port are correct and that there are no firewalls blocking the connection.

### Repeater and Room Server Issues

- If repeaters or room servers aren't appearing, check that your node has correct time synchronization
- Verify the public key used for repeater/room server login is correct
- Try increasing the repeater update interval if connections are unreliable
- For room servers, make sure you've added them as repeaters first to establish the connection
- Room server messages are broadcast to all connected clients - they'll appear as direct messages from the room server
- Check the Home Assistant logs for detailed error messages related to repeater connections

### Integration Not Working

- Check the Home Assistant logs for error messages related to the MeshCore integration
- Verify that your MeshCore device is working correctly (try using the MeshCore CLI directly)
- Make sure you have the required permissions to access the device (especially for USB devices)
- Try adjusting the update intervals if you're experiencing performance issues

## Support and Development

- Report issues on GitHub
- Contributions are welcome via pull requests

## Requirements

- Home Assistant (version 2023.8.0 or newer)
- MeshCore node with firmware that supports API commands
- For BLE: Bluetooth adapter on the Home Assistant host (direct connection only; proxy connections don't work with PIN pairing)
- For USB: USB port on the Home Assistant host
